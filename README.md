## This branch
is getting rid of Jacks modes so the user will talk to vanila gpt3 model. Then once I have this I'll add the modes back in.

QuackerJack is my Treehacks 2023 project. 
Have you ever found yourself belting your heart out to a rubber duck. 
Only for it to sit there judging you quitely. 
Well now with QuackerJack you can hear your duck judge you out loud.
I built QuackerJack (the frontend) for our Treehacks project and ServerJack (the backend server) was built by my team mates Andrew and Jyotika.
Eventually I want to move even the backend onto the mobile device as well. 
So watch this repo to stay tuned for when that happens
